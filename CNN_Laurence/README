1. Simple neural network

In this notebook, we use a simple neural network. Our neural network will learn the relationship between two numbers. 
By feeding it with a set of Xs, and a set of Ys, it should be able to figure out the relationship between them.

2. Computer Vision using Neural network

In the first notebook, we saw how to create a neural network that figured out the problem we were trying to solve. 
This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it 
would have been easier to write the function Y=3x+1 directly, instead of bothering with using Machine Learning to 
learn the relationship between X and Y for a fixed set of values, and extending that for all values.

But what about a scenario where writing rules like that is much more difficult -- for 
example a computer vision problem? Let's take a look at a scenario where we can recognize 
different items of clothing, trained from a dataset containing 10 different types.

3. Convolutions

What are Convolutions?
In this notebook, we will explore what they are and how they work, and then in next notebook, we will see how to use 
them in our neural network.

Together with convolutions, we'll use something called 'Pooling', which compresses our image, further 
emphasising the features. We'll also see how pooling works in this notebook.

Limitations of the previous DNN
In the last notebok, we saw how to train an image classifier for fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
This gave us a pretty accuract classifier, but there was an obvious constraint: the images were 28x28, grey scale and 
the item was centered in the image.
